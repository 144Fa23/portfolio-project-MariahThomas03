			<h1>Hobbies</h1>
			<p>In my free time you'll likely catch me listening to music, reading a book, or looking at shoes. I'm a sucker for a day filled with going to thrift stores, and record stores.</p>
			<h1>Goals</h1>
			<p>Some things that I would like to accomplish this year to help me move further along within my coding journey is landing a internship that would give me exposure to a job in my major. I would also like to figure out what exaclty I want to do with my degree, and what field would best suite the qualities I can offer to a buisiness. </p>
			<h1>Background</h1>
			<p>I was born and raised in the one and only, Kansas City! I come from a big family of 7, and just this past year became a auntie. Being raised in a big family taught me alot of life skills that have followed me throughout my life. Learning how to advocate for myself, taking responisibility, and showing respect for every person I come across, are just the few of things that my family have helped me learn, and are impactful to why I'm equipped for any job.</p>
			<h1>Education</h1>
			<p>I'm currenlty a sophomore at the illustrious institution of NWMSU, and pursuing a degree of Visual Imaging with a focus in Computer Science. I've always been someone who has shared interest in both the arts, and sciences. So being able to combine both of those worlds in my studies sounded like heaven to me.</p>
